- **Zero Configuration** - Deploy once, use immediately with comprehensive monitoring
- **Enterprise Security** - RSA key-pair authentication with complete audit trails
- **Performance Optimized** - 4x faster response times with intelligent caching

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Business Users
```bash
# View the dashboard
npm start
open http://localhost:3000/dashboard.html
```

### For Developers  
```bash
# Deploy the full system
npm run deploy:native

# Test everything works
npm run test:integration

# Check security compliance
npm run check:guards
```

### For Claude Code
```bash
# Single authorized access path
sf status                                   # Check connection
sf sql "CALL MCP.DASH_GET_METRICS(...)"     # Execute dashboard queries
sf exec-file scripts/my-analysis.sql        # Run analysis scripts
```

## 📊 Dashboard Capabilities

### Pre-Built Analytics
- **Time Series**: Hourly, daily, weekly trends with smart grouping
- **Top-N Rankings**: Most active users, frequent actions, error patterns  
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live event counts, performance indicators
- **Dynamic Pivots**: Cross-tabulation and correlation analysis
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time activity feeds

### Business Intelligence Features
- **Executive Presets**: One-click "Today", "This Week", "Last Hour" views
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for tablet and phone viewing
- **Auto-Refresh**: Live updates every 5 minutes
- **Natural Language**: Text-to-query with Claude API integration

## 🏛️ The Two-Table Architecture

This system is built on the **Two-Table Law** - a revolutionary approach that stores everything as events:

```sql
1. LANDING.RAW_EVENTS     -- All data ingestion
2. ACTIVITY.EVENTS        -- Dynamic table with real-time processing
```

**No other tables. Ever.** This architecture provides:
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every operation is an event
- **Infinite Scalability**: Event streams handle any volume
- **Zero Schema Drift**: No table proliferation or management overhead
- **Natural Analytics**: Events are perfect for time-series analysis

## 🔐 Enterprise Security

### Multi-Layer Security
- **RSA Key-Pair Authentication**: Industry-standard cryptographic security
- **Single Access Path**: All Claude Code operations logged and controlled
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every query, edit, and deployment tracked
- **Repository Guards**: Automated compliance checking and enforcement

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Permissions**: EXECUTE AS OWNER procedures with controlled access
- **Agent Isolation**: AI agents cannot directly access core schemas
- **Secret Management**: Keys stored securely outside repository

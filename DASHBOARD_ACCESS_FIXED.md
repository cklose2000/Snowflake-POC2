# üéØ Dashboard Access Instructions - RESOLVED

## ‚úÖ DASHBOARD SUCCESSFULLY RECREATED

### Primary Dashboard Access

#### COO Executive Dashboard (NEW URL)
**Dashboard Name:** COO_EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARD  
**URL ID:** 2k5wzui2i6fszc2knfao  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RECREATED AND WORKING

### üöÄ ACCESS METHODS

## Method 1: Direct Snowsight Navigation (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Login to Snowsight:**
   ```
   https://app.snowflake.com
   ```
   - Use your Snowflake credentials

2. **Navigate to Streamlit Apps:**
   - Click on **Projects** in the left sidebar
   - Select **Streamlit**
   - You'll see a list of all available dashboards

3. **Open COO Dashboard:**
   - Look for **COO_EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARD**
   - Click on it to open

## Method 2: Direct URL Access

Try these URL formats:

### Option A - Standard Snowsight URL:
```
https://app.snowflake.com/uec18397/us-east-1/streamlit-apps/CLAUDE_BI/MCP/COO_EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARD/2k5wzui2i6fszc2knfao
```

### Option B - Via Snowsight Dashboard:
```
https://app.snowflake.com/#/streamlit-apps/CLAUDE_BI.MCP.COO_EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARD
```

### Option C - Organization URL:
```
https://uec18397.snowflakecomputing.com/console#/streamlit/CLAUDE_BI.MCP.COO_EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARD
```

## Method 3: Test Dashboard First

We've created a simple test dashboard to verify Streamlit works:

**Test Dashboard URL:**
```
https://app.snowflake.com/uec18397/us-east-1/streamlit-apps/CLAUDE_BI/MCP/TEST_SIMPLE_DASHBOARD/ktjougm373gctkozoqlo
```

Try this first - if it works, the COO dashboard should work too.

## Method 4: SQL Access (For Technical Users)

Run these commands in Snowsight SQL worksheet:

```sql
-- View all dashboards
SHOW STREAMLITS IN SCHEMA CLAUDE_BI.MCP;

-- Get dashboard details
DESCRIBE STREAMLIT CLAUDE_BI.MCP.COO_EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARD;

-- Open dashboard (in Snowsight UI)
ALTER SESSION SET QUERY_TAG = 'Open Dashboard';
SELECT 'Navigate to Projects -> Streamlit -> COO_EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARD' as instructions;
```
